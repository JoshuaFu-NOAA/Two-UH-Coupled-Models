INSTALLATION
------------

This version of ECHAM is doing IO for the initial and restart files
based on NCAR's netCDF (see http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf).  
Take care that you use the right setup for your Fortran compiler when
installing netCDF.

Configuration files for a number of operating systems and/or compilers are 
provided in the config directory. Please check your system's configuration
file and edit it according to your needs. If you do any additional system port 
let us know about it.

You have to set the variable NETCDFROOT to the netCDF root
directory on your machine in the machine specific mh-'file'. 
At MPI this is on the Suns:

NETCDFROOT = /client

For use of MPI you have to set nothing which enables a compilation
without MPI. Or you have to provide the required information in the
machine specific mh-'file'.

To compile you simply stay in the main directory echam4 and type:

configure
gmake

The make system requires GNU make. In case you have not installed this
you need to download and install it (eg. from
ftp://ftp.uni-hamburg.de/pub/soft/gnu/make).

RUNNING
-------

To run echam4 cd to echam4/run and edit the file hjob.
Edit machine specific items: qsub options, the path to echam4_dat in INI4POOL
and the way the executable is started (mpirun, mpprun,...) at the end of the
script.

For RES fill in either 106 for the T106 resolution (160x320 grid
points) or 30 for the T30 resolution (48x96 grid points).

Finally, choose the number of CPUs, NCPUS, and the way they are horizontally
decomposed, i.e. NPROCA (# of CPUs in north/south direction) and NPROCB (# of
CPUs in east/west direction).

The following restrictions apply:
                  (T30) (T106)
NPROCA <= nlat/2  = 24     80  (nlat = # of latitudes)
NPROCB <= nlon    = 96    320  (nlev = # of levels)

Choose NPROCA so that nlat/2 >= 3 (joverlap).
Parts of the computations are performed in spectral space. For these
computations (and the Fourier and Legendre transformations) vertical
levels or wavenumbers are spread over different processors.

In order to obtain good load balancing for large processor numbers it
is recommended that nlat/2 and nlev+1 should be a multiple of NPROCA
and NPROCB, respectively. Generally partitioning in north south
direction (NPROCA > NPROCB) is more efficient.

The following restrictions are recommended:
                  (T30) (T106)
NPROCB <= nlev+1  = 20     20  (nlev = # of levels)

Generally NCPUS should be NPROCA x NPROCB. If NCPUS is chosen to be
NPROCA x NPROCB + 1 the additional processor is used to run the model
on the full domain. The results of this processor are compared to the
results obtained on the decomposed domain at certain breakpoints.  The
program aborts if differences occur.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
----------------------

1. Configuration files for a larger set of operating systems and/or
   compiler are given in the config directory. Please check out your 
   system's configuration file. If you do any additional system port, 
   let us know about it.

2. Missing preprocessor option

   For compiler which does not have a preprocessor enabling option, we
   provide a perl script, util/f2F.pl. First copy this file into the main
   echam4 directory and check the path to your perl binary at top of this
   script. It changes all .f90 to .F90. As far as we know this files will
   be automatically preprocessed by all compilers we found until now. This 
   script patches as well the Makefiles, changing as well all .f90 to .F90 
   and configure is patched to check as well for f95 compilers.

3. Installation hints for netCDF on Fujitsu VPP700



   The fortran compiler is unknown in the netCDF package, so it must be set 
   by an environment variable:	

csh:  setenv FC frt	 
 sh:  FC=frt; export FC

   this should be done before configure.

   After running two adjustments have to be made. First add an frt compatible
   compiler information for cfortran in macros.make adding -DNAGf90Fortran to 
   the CFLAGS:

   CFLAGS = -O -DNAGf90Fortran

   configure cannot find the definition of ssize_t, usually located 
   in sys/types.h (it's in unistd.h). This must be adjusted in 
   libsrc/ncconfig.h: 

   Change 

	#define ssize_t int 

   to 

        /* #undef ssize_t */

   The fortran tests doesn't work, but the fortran interface seems to work.

   Note: This is not necessary on the VPP5000 any more. 	

4. It should be noted that the Sun Workshop f90 compiler in all versions 
   is not able to handle the model. For using ECHAM on a Sun workstation
   another compiler is required. We develop using the Fujitsu f95 compiler.

   At MPI/DKRZ please include

   if ( -r /afs/dkrz.de/sw/s25/fujitsu_f90/bin ) then
     set path = (/afs/dkrz.de/sw/s25/fujitsu_f90/bin $path )
     setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH /afs/dkrz.de/sw/s25/fujitsu_f90/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
     setenv WB_WIN_KIND 1
     setenv MANPATH /afs/dkrz.de/sw/s25/fujitsu_f90/man:$MANPATH
   endif  

   in your .login or .cshrc.  

   Note: It seems that the newest version of the Sun Compiler (Forte 6) is
         able to compile the model with very good performance.	

5. On Fujitsu VPP the model does not work with MPI 1.x. You definitely need
   MPI 2 (/usr/lang/mpi2 at ECMWF).
 
6. NEC:

   The file mo_transpose.f90 in /modules needs to be compiled with the 
   -vsafe option (edit the Makefile in /modules manually). There are still
   a lot of performance bugs pending. 

7. NAG compiler:

   The NAG compiler does not support an option to force preprocessing.
   We have added a perl script which does the required changes. It can
   be found in util/f2F.pl. Please use it after configure.

   If compiling with the option -C=all, the option -mismatch has to be added 
   for mo_mpi.f90 and mo_nudging.f90 in /modules and lti.f90 and ltd.f90 in
   /src (edit the Makefile in /modules and /src manually).
