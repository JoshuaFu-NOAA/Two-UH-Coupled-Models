This is a short discription on how to check the ECHAM model results.

First install the postprocessing routines in 'post/bin'.

  - Change the working directory to 'post':

    > cd post

  - Create and install the postprocessing programs:

    > gmake

    This directory is not part of the ECHAM configuration
    tree. If you have some problems to create the programs
    then you have to edit the Makefile by yourself.


After the installation you can start with the check of
the model result. 

You need an ECHAM4 model output file for a one day simulation
with a write-up frequency for every timestep. That means
you have to set the following lines in the namelist RUNCTL:

  NWTIME=-1,
  NPTIME=1,

The output file can be checked easily with the following procedure.

  - Change the working directory to 'post/table':

    > cd post/table

  - Check model result:
  
    > checkmoddat <modelresult>

    for example:
 
    > checkmoddat ../../data/99999test_000101.01

The shell script 'checkmoddat' works in three steps.

  - select the temperature for all levels [afterburner].
  - create an ASCII file with the zonal mean from above [createtab].
  - compare this ASCII table with a reference table [anatab].

The result shows you where the maximum difference of temperature
is. This difference should be less than 0.02 [Kelvin] for the 
first timestep and less then 0.3 [Kelvin] for the last timestep.
