ECHAM4 SST Files (Unit 20)
==========================

Structure
---------

 Resolution:

  T21  :  NGL =  32, NLON =  64
  T30  :  NGL =  48, NLON =  96
  T42  :  NGL =  64, NLON = 128
  T63  :  NGL =  96, NLON = 192
  T106 :  NGL = 160, NLON = 320


 Data records:

  Each file contains 12 month (Jan, Feb,...,Dec). Each Month has the 
  following structure:
  NGL latitudes in "ping-pong" format, each latitude contains NLON 
  longitudes values.
  The data must be writen in 64 bit CRAY binary format.

 Contents:

  Each Month contains the Sea Surface Temperature (SST) over
  sea points and a climate temperature over land points in Kelvin.
  All sea points less equal CTFREEZ (CTFREEZ = 273.16 - 1.79)
  are sea ice.

Programs
--------

 It exist some programs to read and write SST files on the 
 CRAY C90 (sea and lake).

 Read SST files:

   The program 'sst2srp' reads an SST file and convert it to
   the pure service format.

       sst2srp sstfile srpfile

 Write SST files:

   The program 'srp2sst' convert a file in pure service format
   to the SST file format.

       srp2sst srpfile sstfile

 Both programs are installt on the 'sea' and 'lake' in:

   /pf/m/m214003/public
