ECHAM4 Surface Initial Files (Unit 24)
======================================

Structure
---------

 The files are divided into two sections - a data description section
 containing records which describe the data, followed by data records
 which contain the data. 

 Resolution:

  T21  :  NGL =  32, NLON =  64
  T30  :  NGL =  48, NLON =  96
  T42  :  NGL =  64, NLON = 128
  T63  :  NGL =  96, NLON = 192
  T106 :  NGL = 160, NLON = 320

  NLP2 = NLON + 2

 Data description records (DDR):

  Data decription records describe the data in the data section. Data
  decription records always begin with a section containing items
  of type INTEGER. Word 1 of each DDR indicates its effective length
  in words, word 2 the number of integer items in the first section,
  and word 3 the effective length of the next DDR, or zero if the
  current DDR is the last DDR. The general contens of the data decription
  records are discussed in Research Manual 2 (ECMWF forecast model).
  The Surface Initial files have normaly 5 DDRs with 3072 words each.

 Data records:

  A Gaussian latitude/longitude grid is used. NGL latitudes records are ordered
  row 1 (North), row 1 (South), row 2 (North), row 2 (South), etc. (ping-pong).
  Each latitude contains 15 variables with NLP2 words each. Only NLON words 
  are significant. All variables are of type "real" except No.9 which is a 
  typeless packed array.

 Variables on each latitude:

Programs
--------

 It exist some programs to read and write Surface Initial files on the 
 CRAY C90 (sea and lake).

 Read Surface Initial files:

   The program 'INI2SRV4' reads an Surface Initial file and convert it to
   the pure service format.

       INI2SRV4 inifile srpfile

 Write Surface Initial files:

   The program 'INI4SRV4' convert a file in pure service format
   to the Surface Initial file format. The outputfile must be an old
   Surface Initial file from which the program will use the DDR's for 
   the new Surface Initial file.

 Both programs are installt on the 'sea' and 'lake' in:
