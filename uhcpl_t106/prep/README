This directory contains programs and scripts to convert
initial and sst data for the ECHAM f90 version from netCDF to
8 Byte IEEE SERVICE format and back.
It also contains some programs to convert the initial data from 
the f77 ECHAM4 version (CRAY pure binary format) to netCDF or SERVICE.

Install:
-------

'gmake' install the programs in the bin directory.

modify 'Make.config' to change: 
	NETCDFROOT	directory with the libs and include files of netCDF
	CC		C-compiler
	CFLAGS		options
	DDEBUG		if you want debug informations


Programs:
--------

     The following programs are available:

     - Atmosphere initial data (unit:23)

         inispec2anc:  Convert from CRAY to netCDF

     - Surface initial data (unit:24)

         inisurf2snc:  Convert from CRAY to netCDF 
         snc2srv:      Convert from netCDF to SERVICE 
         srv2snc:      Convert from SERVICE to netCDF 

     - Annual cycle monthly mean data (SST, SIC, LAI, VEGETATION)

         year2ync:     Convert from CRAY to netCDF 
         ync2srv:      Convert from netCDF to SERVICE
         srv2ync:      Convert from SERVICE to netCDF 

     - Optional global fields (unit:13 and 14)

         fld2srv:      Convert from CRAY to SERVICE 
         fnc2srv:      Convert from netCDF to SERVICE 
         srv2fnc:      Convert from SERVICE to netCDF 

     - Ozone data (unit:21)

         ozon2srv:     Convert from CRAY to SERVICE 
         onc2srv:      Convert from netCDF to SERVICE 
         srv2onc:      Convert from SERVICE to netCDF
 
     - Restart data (unit:31-37)

         res2rnc:      Convert from CRAY to Netcdf
                       (write unit 33 and 34 to unit 31)


     CRAY    : means CRAY binray data (from ECHAM f77 version)
     SERVICE : means 8 Byte IEEE SERVICE format
