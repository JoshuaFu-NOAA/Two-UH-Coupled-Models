 0. News:
    The "afterburner" is one program now, which is able to process
    model data represented in T21, T42, T63 and T106 resolution in
    gridpoint and spectral space. There is no limit for the vertical
    resolution of model data (was 19 levels) except memory limits of
    the job classes.
    The old names "mod21" etc. are kept by linking those names to the
    program "after". "after" is self defining, which means you can call
    "after" instead of "mod21" or "mod42" or "mod63" or "mod106".
    ECHAM4 output files can be processed as well as ECHAM1/2/3 output
    files.
    Last but not least the "after"-program is available on
    NIESEL, REGEN and BLITZ (Sun-Department-Server) and 
    NEPTUN (Convex) in the same version and at the same
    location as on the CRAYs.

 1. The program "after" reads, unpacks, transforms and selects data
    from T-model GRIB files, and writes them either unformatted or 
    in GRIB form for further processing (i.e. plotting).
    Additionally, pressure or height interpolation is optional
    (refer to parameter description of "UNITSEL").

 2. Usage: /pf/k/k204004/burn/after  gribfile resultfile
    or:    /pf/k/k204004/burn/mod21  gribfile resultfile
    or:    /pf/k/k204004/burn/mod42  gribfile resultfile
    or:    /pf/k/k204004/burn/mod63  gribfile resultfile
    or:    /pf/k/k204004/burn/mod106 gribfile resultfile
           ^                         ^        ^
           ^                         ^        Selected fields
           ^                         path/filename of GRIB data
           Executable program

    These programs read selection parameters as namelist from
    stdin  (standard input) and write some informative messages to
    stdout (standard output). Abort messages can be found on
    stderr (standard error).

    Use the UNIX redirection "< namelistfile" to read the
    namelist from file.

 3. Namelist: &SELECT  TYPE = , CODE  = , LEVEL = , MULTI = ,
              MEAN = , GRIB = , HEAD7 = , TIMESEL = , UNITSEL =    &END

  default ->  TYPE  =  0 : Hybrid             level spectral coefficients
              TYPE  = 10 : Hybrid             level fourier  coefficients
              TYPE  = 11 : Hybrid             level zonal mean sections
              TYPE  = 20 : Hybrid             level gauss grids
              TYPE  = 30 : Pressure or Height level gauss grids
              TYPE  = 40 : Pressure or Height level fourier  coefficients
              TYPE  = 41 : Pressure or Height level zonal mean sections
              TYPE  = 50 : Pressure or Height level spectral coefficients
              TYPE  = 60 : Pressure or Height level fourier  coefficients
              TYPE  = 61 : Pressure or Height level zonal mean sections
              TYPE  = 70 : Pressure or Height level gauss grids

              CODE  =  1 - 255 ECMWF field codes (130=Temperature, etc.)
                     256 - 258 : internal
                           259 : sqrt(u*u + v*v)
                           260 : largescale + convective rain
                           261 : total top    radiation
                           262 : total bottom radiation
                           263 : net heat  flux
                           264 : net water flux

              LEVEL =: Up to NN + 1 hybrid, pressure or height levels
                       (depending on TYPE and UNITSEL !!!)
                       NN depends on model type (either 19, 25 or 35)

  default ->  MULTI =  0 : Process only one input file
              MULTI =  n : Process "n" input files - each containing
                           one month. Put only the name of the first
                           input file on the command line. All subsequent
                           files are expected to be in the same directory.
                           The filenames must follow the syntax
                           experiment_YYMM, where YY denotes the year
                           and MM the month.

  default ->  DAYIN = 30 : Day step for incrementing input file names
              DAYIN = nn : Day step is nn days
                           Used only in conjunction with MULTI != 0.
                           Since ECHAM4 output files follow the
                           naming convention
                              experiment_YYMM.DD
                           DAYIN is the time step in days between
                           subsequent input files for MULTI != 0.

  default ->  MEAN  =  0 : Write out all terms
              MEAN  =  1 : Compute and write monthly mean fields
                           !!! Only for TYPE >= 20 !!!
              MEAN  =  2 : Compute and write monthly deviations.
                           !!! Only for TYPE = 20 or TYPE = 30 !!!
              MEAN  =  3 : Combination of MEAN=1 and MEAN=2.
                           Each mean field is followed by a deviation
                           field with an identical header record.
                           !!! Only for TYPE = 20 or TYPE = 30 !!!

              GRIB  =  1 : The resultfile is also in GRIB form!
                           CURENTLY THIS OPTION WORKS WITH
                           TYPES 20 ,30, 50 or 70 ONLY !!!
  default ->  GRIB  =  0 : The resultfile is an unblocked binary data file
                           with the following structure:
                           The whole file consists of pairs of
                           header record and data record.
                           The header record is an integer array
                           of 8 elements.

  default ->  HEAD7 =  0 : This parameter is for your personal use.
                           All header records take this value to
                           their 7th. element.
              head(1) = ECMWF field code
              head(2) = level (1-19) or pressure in [Pa]
              head(3) = date  [yymmdd]  (yymm00 for monthly means)
              head(4) = time  [hh]      (    -1 for monthly means)
              head(5) = 1. dimension of data array
              head(6) = 2. dimension of data array
              head(7) = may be set with the parameter HEAD7
              head(8) = experiment number (extracted from filename)

  default ->TIMESEL = -1 : The resultfile contains the same timesteps
                           per day as the input gribfile.
                           Multiple values may be specified, i.e.
                              TIMESEL = 0, 12, 18
                           Note that only hours existing in the input
                           file can be specified.
                           (No time interpolation or average is done)

  default ->UNITSEL =  0 : Pressure interpolation (TYPE >= 30)
                           or hybrid level output (TYPE <= 20).
                           Unlike before, pressure levels less than 100 Pa
                           can be processed (except 0 and negative values).
            UNITSEL =  1 : Height   interpolation 
                           Values specified for LEVEL are interpreted
                           as height-meters       (TYPE >= 30).
                           (Maximum LEVEL: 65535 m)
            UNITSEL =  2 : Height   interpolation 
                           Values specified for LEVEL are interpreted
                           as height-kilometers   (TYPE >= 30).
                           (Maximum LEVEL: 65   km)

 4. Example for reading the resultfile on UNICOS 8.0.? (GRIB = 0):

          assign -s unblocked -a resultfile u:10

          INTEGER HEAD(8)
          REAL    FIELD(64,32)     ! dimensions for T21 grids
          READ (10,ERR=888,END=999) HEAD
          READ (10,ERR=888,END=999) FIELD
          ....
      888 STOP 'I/O ERR'
      999 STOP 'EOF'
          ....

 5. Troubleshooting:
    The program writes unblocked data (without any record information).
    Be sure to assign the 'unblocked' attribute to the file, before
    reading it with the FORTRAN <READ>- or CRAY FORTRAN <BUFFER IN>-
    statement. Using <fread> you don't need an assign.

    Check your namelist, especially for invalid codes, types and levels.

    If all else fails rerun the program with an additional parameter
    called "Debug" e.g.:

    mod21 <my_namelist >myoutput modelfile resultfile Debug

    then make the output available with "chmod" and
    call or mail the support group at DKRZ.

 6. Possible combinations of TYPE, CODE and MEAN

    TYPE =  0 : CODE = 130  temperature           MEAN = 0
                       131  u-velocity
                       132  v-velocity
                       133  specific humidity
                       138  vorticity
                       148  streamfunction
                       149  velocity potential
                       152  LnPs
                       155  divergence

    TYPE = 10: CODE = (same as TYPE 0)            MEAN = 0

    TYPE = 11: CODE = (same as TYPE 0)            MEAN = 0

    TYPE > 11: CODE = (all codes)                 MEAN = 0/1

    Vorticity, divergence, streamfunction and velocity potential
    need special treatment in the vertical transformation.
    They are not available as types 30, 40 and 41.
    If you select one of these combinations, type is automatically
    switched to the equivalent types 70, 60 and 61.
